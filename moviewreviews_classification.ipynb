) \\r\\nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \\r\\nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \\r\\nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \\r\\nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \\r\\nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \\r\\nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \\r\\nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \\r\\nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \\r\\nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \\r\\nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \\r\\nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \\r\\nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \\r\\nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\r\\n\",\n          \"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \\r\\nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \\r\\nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \\r\\nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \\r\\ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \\\" couldn't care less about the truth \\\" but was more interested in capturing \\\" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \\\" \\r\\ndespite violating nearly every rule of \\\" legitimate \\\" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \\r\\nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \\r\\nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \\r\\nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \\\" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \\\" ) to mary tyler moore ( \\\" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \\\" ) to style ( \\\" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \\\" ) . \\r\\nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \\r\\nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \\r\\nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \\r\\nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \\r\\non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \\r\\na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \\r\\nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \\r\\nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \\r\\nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \\r\\noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \\r\\nwhen the designer declares that \\\" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \\\" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

) \\r\\nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \\r\\nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \\r\\nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \\r\\nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \\r\\nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \\r\\nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \\r\\nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \\r\\nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \\r\\nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \\r\\nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \\r\\nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \\r\\nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \\r\\nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\r\\n\",\n          \"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \\r\\nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \\r\\nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \\r\\nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \\r\\ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \\\" couldn't care less about the truth \\\" but was more interested in capturing \\\" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \\\" \\r\\ndespite violating nearly every rule of \\\" legitimate \\\" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \\r\\nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \\r\\nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \\r\\nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \\\" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \\\" ) to mary tyler moore ( \\\" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \\\" ) to style ( \\\" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \\\" ) . \\r\\nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \\r\\nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \\r\\nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \\r\\nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \\r\\non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \\r\\na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \\r\\nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \\r\\nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \\r\\nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \\r\\noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \\r\\nwhen the designer declares that \\\" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \\\" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

film festival . \\r\\nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . \\r\\nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \\r\\nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \\r\\ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \\r\\nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \\r\\nsomething else is what he did . \\r\\nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \\r\\nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \\r\\nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \\r\\nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \\r\\nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \\r\\nshe does not know who the woman is . \\r\\nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \\r\\nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \\r\\nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \\r\\nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \\r\\nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \\r\\nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \\r\\nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \\r\\na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \\r\\nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \\r\\nhe just chooses not to . \\r\\nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \\r\\nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \\r\\nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \\r\\ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \\r\\nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \\r\\ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\r\\nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \\r\\ni have rated this film fairly low . \\r\\nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \\r\\ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \\r\\nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \\r\\nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \\r\\nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \\r\\nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \\r\\nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \\r\\nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \\r\\nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \\r\\nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \\r\\nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \\r\\nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \\r\\nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \\r\\nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \\r\\nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \\r\\nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \\r\\nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \\r\\nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\r\\n\",\n          \"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \\r\\nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \\r\\nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \\r\\nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \\r\\ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \\\" couldn't care less about the truth \\\" but was more interested in capturing \\\" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \\\" \\r\\ndespite violating nearly every rule of \\\" legitimate \\\" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \\r\\nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \\r\\nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \\r\\nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \\\" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \\\" ) to mary tyler moore ( \\\" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \\\" ) to style ( \\\" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \\\" ) . \\r\\nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \\r\\nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \\r\\nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \\r\\nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \\r\\non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \\r\\na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \\r\\nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \\r\\nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \\r\\nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \\r\\noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \\r\\nwhen the designer declares that \\\" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \\\" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n
